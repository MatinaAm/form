*In this project, I utilized react-toastify for user alerts 
*and a helper file for cleaner code structure and adherence to the DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principle.
 *I also employed react-hook-form for managing form data and performed validation prior to submission. 
 *Additionally, I used react-highlight-words to highlight search results within tables.
